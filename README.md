# Monads
Play with monads


#### Implement mondas applying functional programming

#### Helpers
1. dot (misssing partial application capabilities)
2. matches (similar to elixir's cond)
3. curry (just a curry)


#### Mondas

1. That there is a way to take a value of an unamplified type and turn it into a value of the amplified type.
2. That there is a way to transform operations on the unamplified type into operations on the amplified type that obeys the rules of functional composition mentioned before
3. That there is usually a way to get the unamplified type back out of the amplified type. (This last point isn't strictly necessary for a monad but it is frequently the case that such an operation exists.)

.... More to come!
